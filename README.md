# Quick Guide to Git for Thomas

First, download a Git UI (it'll make everything much easier for you)
I recommend Fork.
https://git-fork.com/

You'll also need a Github account if you don't have one.

Go to the Repo:
https://github.com/DempseyBlum/SAS-Rom-Hack

Select the [<> Code] button, and copy the HTTPS url it gives you.

In Fork, make sure you've logged in with your Github account.
Then go File -> Clone... and paste the URL in
Take a note of the Parent Folder, change it to wherever you want it to live. 
This is what you'll be editing so place it somewhere you'll remember.
Once you're happy, press [Clone]

Once you've cloned down the repo, you will have a copy of the source code.
It'll be sitting on your computer in whatever file you told it to.
Any changes you make to this code will only affect your version.

If you're happy with any changes you've made, you'll need to commit them.
There'll be a section called "Local Changes".
Simply "Stage" those changes, add a commit message like "Added new sprite for Syrra" and commit it.

This will put it up, and allow me to pull down your changes on my machine.

Similarly, you'll need to pull down any changes I make. This is done by right clicking the "main" branch, and selected "Pull"
Just shoot me a message if you have any trouble, it can be intimidating initially.

Don't worry about branches, just work off of "main".
